## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

- avoid duplication, search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.

## Commit Message Format
we follow [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) style, which is used in mega projects like Angular and gatsbyjs.

- commit message consists of a header, an optional body and an optional footer, with a double blank line between them.
- the header includes a summary title, the action type and an optional scope
- the body including extra description.
- the footer includes the issue this commit fixes (ex: fixes #22) and may start with `BREAKING CHANGE` note.
- the scope is a project or a package or a sub-workspace.
